## About
This is the portfolio of Lucas Newman, a software designer / developer. It has had 4 editions. First edition used a website edititor called Wix, it was based of of the New South Wales department of education school's website, with a red theming. As my style progressed I designed a Yellow and black website in a modern theme. but then I decided to code my Portfolio using Flutter. My first design was a design based on Instagram and other social media apps but I soon upgraded it back to a modern theming this time with a colour change to a more blue and aqua style.
