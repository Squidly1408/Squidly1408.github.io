        You can do anything you want, you can change the stars, you can rewrite what others may take as fact. you can
        make the laws of physics bend to your words if you may want, (not sure if u actually can or not, but im like :/
        yea she can probably). the point is I believe in you, more then anything else, more then anyone could ever
        believe.

        you changed my life for the better, you have made me into someone I can be proud of bc you supported me, and I
        hope I have done the same for you, and I hope you go on to do whatever dreams you may have, bc I will always
        support you hasign your dreams, or being happy, as you will always have a spot in my heart.
