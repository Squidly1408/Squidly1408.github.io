# Senior Project

A Senior Project is a personal project that is meant to act as a pillar stone of your projects at Cooks Hill Campus (CHC), a project that wraps up your time at CHC and a project that helps your future goals what ever they may be. 

So, knowing that your senior project is meant to help with your future goals, what are my future goals? and how does my Senior Project help me achieve them?

Well my future goals are to get into The University of Newcastle and study software Engineering 

Well my Senior Project is based on creating a portfolio of experience and projects to demonstrate my abilities and skills in the field of software and electronics. Not only does this help my future goals of getting into university but it also affects getting a job, as a portfolio is one of the biggest things when applying to be a software developer or engineer.

## Whats part of my portfolio

### projects
I have completed a multitude of projects, basing from electronics to software. I have worked on them with Associate / Senior Lecturers, an Associate Professor, Students at the University of Newcastle, and many mentors form a variety of companies including SAPHI Engineering. 

Some of my projects Include:

Strocoge: A project where I am creating a glove with embeded electronics aimed to help by provideding a tool to communicate through basic hand gestures and movements. This project has gone through multiple randitions, and has a vast history in my time at Cooks Hill Campus.

AAC App: AAC or Augmentative and ALternative Communication app is an app that got its start when I realised the expenses of the on market Apps and devices. but why create another app that people can use? when you can imporve upon the market by adding features that would helpt those who use AAC devices and apps most. So, I added more customizability to my app.

Luvium: Luvium is a social media website first designed for Cooks Hill Campus to act as a bridge between students to increase colabortation between students projects. However in recent months this project has started to be redesigned for The University of Newcastle, and their students. For this I have worked with Dr Jacqueline Bailey (Associate Lecturer, School of Information and Physical Sciences) on designing the new version and creating connections to better the use of the Web App.

### Experiences

I have had many experiences that have molded me into who I am, Many of them helped me find my passion for software and electronics. Experiences like:

SAPHI Engineering: I have Learnt nearly everything I know about software and electronics from this amazing team of people, I learnt about IDE's, PCB Designing, AI training and so much more. I spent so much time learning from them that I ended up gaining a Job as a junior software developer with them and aim to continue working for them.

Clickk Web Design: This was my first experience in the industry of tech and they taught me so much about how to work with a team of people and designing websites.

RedCrow Digital: Sadly I only conducted a shadow with Redcrow digital, where I ended up finding a bug for them. However I created Life Long mentors from my time with them.

The University of Newcastle: I'm not in university yet however I already know stuff about it, I spent multiple shadow days attending lectures and labs, learning what Uni life is like.

NuBots: I have spent only a shadow day with Nubots however I have learnt alot about hwo they create their sopccar playing robots, I even helped them with getting parts ready for themn to use in the robots they designed.
